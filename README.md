# Prediction-of-COVID-19-Waves
This project aims to predict COVID-19 trends based on the previous total comfirmed cases, confirmed individuals in different age groups, and the beds used in ICU for COVID-19.
The main data sources were the HealthData.gov Hospital Capacity and Patient Impact Timeseries data as well as consolidated data sets utilized by Johns Hopkins University CSSE for their COVID tracking dashboard.
